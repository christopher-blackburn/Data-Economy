NACA OVERVIEW: The Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (âNACAâ) (naca.com) is a non-profit community advocacy and housing services organization. Started in 1988, NACA has a tremendous track record of successful advocacy against predatory and discriminatory lenders. Presently, NACA is the largest housing services organization in the country and is rapidly expanding by growing its existing 30+ offices, opening many new offices nationwide, and expanding the services it offers its membership. NACAâs confrontational community organizing and unprecedented mortgage program have set the national standard for assisting low and moderate income people achieve the dream of home ownership.  Today, NACA has commitments from banks and lenders totaling over $10 Billion for its Best in Americaâmortgage program, which allows NACA Members to purchase or refinance homes with no down payment, no closing costs, no fees, no requirement for perfect credit, and at a below-market interest rate. Everyone gets the same incredible terms, including the below-market interest rate, regardless of their credit score or other factors. NACA also provides free comprehensive housing services. NACA counsels Members into the extraordinary NACA mortgage using character based lending criteria that takes each Memberâs circumstances into account to determine whether they are ready for homeownership and what they can afford. This is in contrast to risk based pricing where people are often put into loans they cannot afford with brokers and other making tremendous fees.  NACA also provides home renovation assistance and post-purchase services. NACAâs Home and Neighborhood Development (âHANDâ) Department addresses repair issues and where appropriate provides rehab assistance throughout the renovation process. NACAâs Home Save Department provides comprehensive counseling for Members who are delinquent on their home, including establishing payment agreements and providing financial assistance to help Members avoid foreclosure. The NACA program is structured through a state-of-the-art mortgage web-based counseling, processing and underwriting software called NACA Lynxâ. This is a paperless system that allows for character lending, and loan processing and underwriting to be done on a very large scale. Virtually 100% of NACA Qualified Members are approved and funded.  NACA has revolutionized mortgage lending with its mortgage services and advocacy. NACAâs organizing department continues the aggressive advocacy against predatory lenders and in fighting for economic justice. NACA is a high-profile organization, having its program and advocacy featured in the national media, including the Wall Street Journal, Prime Time Live, Boston Globe, Washington Post, major news outlets, and local networks nationwide.  NACA STAFF PROFILE: NACA staff has a passion for and commitment to community advocacy and the delivery of excellent services to working people. While advocacy campaigns are an important part of everyoneâs work at NACA, staff spend the majority of their time providing comprehensive housing services to low and moderate people and administering NACAâs homeownership program. NACA offers tremendous opportunities for job growth and career development. NACA has a strong track record of promoting from within and rewarding hard work. NACA seeks staff with a positive and open attitude, a willingness to work hard, and the determination to achieve NACAâs mission. NACA strongly encourages minorities and bilingual people to apply.  POSITION SUMMARY: The Mortgage Consultant is responsible for providing comprehensive housing counseling services to NACA Members. The Mortgage Consultant works with Members to assist them through the home buying process to overcome the roadblocks that prevent them from purchasing a home. The Mortgage Consultant provides individual counseling from the initial intake to the mortgage closing, including counseling regarding: credit, budget, mortgage qualification, property search and inspection, mortgage processing, and closing. The primary responsibility is to have the Member become NACA Qualified (i.e. mortgage ready). Mortgage Consultants make decisions appropriate to the particular Memberâs circumstances, follow-up with problem resolution, and take action to facilitate successful completion of the task(s). The Mortgage Consultant is in fact underwriting the mortgage based on NACAâs character lending criteria and must make individualized judgmentâs about a Memberâs particular circumstances. The services performed by the Mortgage Consultant are a key component of NACAâs business, and of crucial importance to the organization and must administer the program to ensure the success of NACA and the continuous commitment of the funding sources. In the discharge of these duties, the Mortgage Consultant must accomplish the following on a day-to-day basis:  Counsel and address Memberâs credit and budget issues.  Qualify Members for home ownership based on their unique financial and personal circumstances and needs.  Determine the maximum purchase price they can afford based on their unique financial and personal circumstances and needs.  Assist Members during the housing search and home purchase.  Originate the mortgage.  Follow-up with Member on a regular basis.  Coordinate with NACAâs Underwriting Department.  Work with the NACAâs HAND Department on property repair and contractor issues.  Obtain documents needed for qualifications, underwriting, and closings.  Maintain Member information in the computer system and files.  Participate in presenting homebuyer and home ownership workshops.  Coordinate rehab and home improvement programs.  Assist in outreach focused on low/moderate income communities, churches and job sites.  Assist in advocacy campaigns.  Other duties as assigned.  COMPENSATION: NACA is the only job in the mortgage industry that allows you to provide low and moderate income borrowers with an incredible mortgage and make considerable income without engaging in abusive sub-prime market lending practices. The compensation at NACA is based on the NACA Results Compensation Program- NRCP.âThe commission-based NRCP begins after the first three months of employment, during which the compensation is straight salary in order to allow for training of the Mortgage Consultant and his/her development of a pipeline. The structure of the NRCP Program is results-based (i.e. earnings are relative to the number of loans closed), with a regularly paid draw that provides Mortgage Consultants with a minimum cash flow. The NRCP is very different from other commission-based plans used by for-profit mortgage brokers and lenders because:  1. NACA offers one single product to its Members, which is the Best Mortgage in America, with no down payment, no closing costs, no fees, and a below-market interest rate. NACA provides the lowest fixed interest rate for all mortgage applicants whether a prime or sub-prime borrower;  2. Compensation is paid at a fixed amount, regardless of the loan amount or any other terms. Thus, NACA Mortgage Consultants do not have to pit their own interests against those of the borrower since they do not have to charge front-end and back-end points (i.e. yield spreads) to earn or increase their commission;  3. The NRCP provides an advance of pay during periods when the Mortgage Consultant does not close loans, which is repaid by the Mortgage Consultant from future closings;  4. NACA Mortgage Consultants are not required to independently generate leads on a regular basis since NACA develops leads through workshops and other means, and the interest in the NACA Mortgage and active participation already exists and is growing. NACA has huge numbers of people accessing its program. These participants are extremely good leads that could not be generated through traditional sources;  5. Mortgage Consultants counsel borrowers in the office and focus on getting them NACA Qualified;  6. NACA Qualification is a character-based lendingâand not a risk-based pricing. NACA approves Members based on their overall circumstances and not on rigid criteria;  7. NACA Mortgage Consultants have at their disposal a state-of-the-art computer hardware and software system (âNACA Lynxâ), which makes for a fast, efficient and paperless mortgage qualification, processing and underwriting process;  8. A NACA Mortgage Consultant is expected to close five to ten per month and earn $45,000 to $65,000+.  This job description is solely for descriptive purposes and the responsibilities may change. This job description does not constitute a contract for employment. Job RequirementsÂ JOB REQUIREMENTS: A. EDUCATION:  Bachelorâs degree preferred  Mortgage and/or real estate courses are helpful  B. EXPERIENCE:  Mortgage brokerage, origination, processing and/or counseling  C.

Specifically, as a part of account management responsibilities, the role of the RD is to respond to client rfps, direct the proposal writing and study design; use advanced moderating techniques with ease, working independently or as part of a multi-member team; provide strategic analytics and presenting research findings to large international and cross-discipline client groups.  Overall itâs about the long-term client relationship âthe RD doesnât just do good work, they need to be constantly alert to strategic opportunities and threats. Their skills and presence should be such that theyâre regularly successfully running significant meetings and presentations. But they need to never be an island - and think through the right time to get the Partner or MD involved in a way that safeguards and enhances our business Bachelors Degree  . ""Growing"" the team for which the RD has management responsibility is a critical part of achieving this. They will have direct management responsibility for a team of capable, ambitious executives who need to be stretched and developed so that they can themselves increasingly run clients and projects. The team is likely to consist of between two to five people. Overall, the RD role is fundamentally about adding to the business âcritically it is about building things, and changing the shape of the business in a material fashion - not just managing revenue. It requires someone with distinctive individual potential âplaying a crucial role in the overall success of Hall & Partners.

The no frills, low overhead, cash-and-carry environment provided good value at the lowest price points. As the company opened more stores, it became clear that this merchandising concept filled a niche in the marketplace and held great promise for supporting a chain of much larger size. Refinements have been made through the years, but we have never lost sight of our original concept. From the beginning, all our efforts have been focused on meeting the needs of our customer base for good quality, low-cost, basic merchandise.

Hobbyist and homeowner woodworking questions are inappropriate.  Messages should be kept reasonably short and on topic, relating to the focus of the forum. Responses should relate to the original question.  A valid email return address must be included with each message.  Advertising is inappropriate. The only exceptions are the Classified AdsExchange, MachineryExchange, LumberExchange, and Job Opportunities and Services Exchange. When posting listings in these areas, review the posting instructions carefully.  Subject lines may be edited for length and clarity.  "" Cross posting"" is not permitted. Choose the best forum for your question, and post your question at one forum only.  Messages requesting private responses will be removed - Forums are designed to provide information and assistance for all of our visitors. Private response requests are appropriate at WOODWEB's Exchanges and Job Opportunities and Services.  Messages that accuse businesses or individuals of alleged negative actions or behavior are inappropriate since WOODWEB is unable to verify or substantiate the claims.  Posts with the intent of soliciting answers to surveys are not appropriate. Contact WOODWEB for more information on initiating a survey.  Excessive forum participation by an individual upsets the balance of a healthy forum atmosphere. Individuals who excessively post responses containing marginal content will be considered repeat forum abusers.  Responses that initiate or support inappropriate and off-topic discussion of general politics detract from the professional woodworking focus of WOODWEB, and will be removed.  Questions or criticisms regarding Forum policies should be directed to WOODWEB's  ( ).  Carefully review your message before clicking on the "" Send Message"" button - you will not be able to revise the message once it has been sent. You will be notified of responses to the message(s) you posted via email. Be sure to enter your email address correctly. WOODWEB's forums are a highly regarded resource for professional woodworkers. Messages and responses that are crafted in a professional and civil manner strengthen this resource. Messages that do not reflect a professional tone reduce the value of our forums. Messages are inappropriate when their content: is deemed libelous in nature or is based on rumor, fails to meet basic standards of decorum, contains blatant advertising or inappropriate emphasis on self promotion ( ). Libel: Posts which defame an individual or organization, or employ a tone which can be viewed as malicious in nature. Words, pictures, or cartoons which expose a person or organization to public hatred, shame, disgrace, or ridicule, or induce an ill opinion of a person or organization, are libelous. Improper Decorum: Posts which are profane, inciting, disrespectful or uncivil in tone, or maliciously worded. This also includes the venting of unsubstantiated opinions. Such messages do little to illuminate a given topic, and often have the opposite effect. Constructive criticism is acceptable ( ). Advertising: The purpose of WOODWEB Forums is to provide answers, not an advertising venue. Companies participating in a Forum discussion should provide specific answers to posted questions. WOODWEB suggests that businesses include an appropriately crafted signature in order to identify their company. A well meaning post that seems to be on-topic but contains a product reference may do your business more harm than good in the Forum environment. Forum users may perceive your references to specific products as unsolicited advertising (spam) and consciously avoid your web site or services. A well-crafted signature is an appropriate way to advertise your services that will not offend potential customers. Signatures should be limited to 4-6 lines, and may contain information that identifies the type of business you're in, your URL and email address ( ). Repeated Forum Abuse: Forum participants who repeatedly fail to follow WOODWEB's Forum Guidelines may encounter difficulty when attempting to post messages. There are often situations when the original message asks for opinions: "" What is the best widget for my type of shop?"" . To a certain extent, the person posting the message is responsible for including specific questions within the message. An open ended question (like the one above) invites responses that may read as sales pitches. WOODWEB suggests that companies responding to such a question provide detailed and substantive replies rather than responses that read as a one-sided product promotion. It has been WOODWEB's experience that substantive responses are held in higher regard by our readers ( ). The staff of WOODWEB assume no responsibility for the accuracy, content, or outcome of any posting transmitted at WOODWEB's Message Boards. Participants should undertake the use of machinery, materials and methods discussed at WOODWEB's Message Boards after considerate evaluation, and at their own risk.
